# no-loss-lottery

Solana Riptide Hackathon

## prompt

No-loss lottery: Build a platform for users to deposit a variety of tokens into a pool and then connect the pool to a Solana lending protocol which aggregates funds and rewards the interest to a winner over a period of time.

### TODO

- how to randomly choose a winning ticket, is it purely just a random token or maybe each ticket has numbers associated to it and draw chooses random numbers? If this were the case it would be possible there would be no winners
- Not sure how to use the funds to farm for interest yet
- create on chain DB to keep track of wallets:tickets
- VRF to pick a random winning ticket
- lottery fees
